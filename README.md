Hello random user, this is my homemade pet-project on NextJS 15 + Prisma (sqlite). If you want to run it just install all node packages via ```npm i``` and then run via ```npm run dev```. If you want to access db, then type ```npx prisma studio```. Hope you will find something usefull for you there.

See you space cowboy...
